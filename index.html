        Prices in North Carolina
      </h2>
      <p>
        Over the past several years, North Carolinians have seen an increase in prices across many spending categories.
        Of course, such increases are not unique to North Carolina, or even to the United States – the impact of the
        COVID-19 Pandemic has been felt economically across the world. This web app tells the story of prices and their
        political impact in North Carolina since 2020.</p>

      <h3>2020</h3>
      <p>North Carolinians started 2020 with expectations of continued improvement in economic conditions. Consumer
        sentiment was relatively high, employment was stable, and talk of inflation or rising prices was scarce. When
        the COVID-19 Pandemic hit, this rosy picture was shaken. While prices didn’t immediately rise (and indeed fell
        in some categories, such as gas), the pandemic registered as an immediate economic threat. In response to
        widespread increases in unemployment and other severe economic impacts, Congress passed significant stimulus
        that included direct cash benefits – stimulus that very successfully curbed the economic fallout in comparison
        to other countries. However, this infusion of money, along with pandemic-induced shocks to supply chains, caused
        inflationary pressures that played out over the years to come.</p>
      <h3>2022</h3>
      <p>By 2022, the word “inflation” was on everyone’s lips. Compared to zero headlines mentioning “inflation” in
        2020,
        the Raleigh News & Observer ran 60 articles in 2022 that included the word “inflation” in the headline. This
        increase in attention was reasonable: prices had shot up, in North Carolina and across the country, and rates of
        inflation were high. Beyond being a concern for people’s pocketbooks, inflation had also emerged as a hot
        political issue just in time for the midterm elections. Congress passed a cornerstone of Joe Biden’s legislative
        platform: the Inflation Reduction Act. Drug pricing reform, investment in American clean energy initiatives, and
        increased taxes on corporations and the wealthy were key provisions in the IRA. Consumer discontent, however,
        continued to rise along with prices.</p>
      <h3>2024</h3>
      <p>While inflation began to slow as Biden neared the end of his term, economic sentiment remained poor. Inflation
        remained a charged topic in advance of 2024 election. Republicans hammered Biden on prices and Donald Trump made
        sweeping promises to lower prices, while Kamala Harris rolled out policy proposals aimed at alleviating costs.
        Despite lowering rates of inflation and overall strong growth in real wages (and therefore purchasing power),
        voters expressed strongly negative views about the economy. Donald Trump’s reelection in November 2024 was in
        line with a worldwide anti-incumbent backlash, which many experts attributed to inflation.</p>
      <h3>2025</h3>
      <p>Though discontent over inflation helped propel Donald Trump to a second term, voters are already realizing that
        his promise to "bring prices down starting on Day One” was all talk. Instead, Trump has pursued tariff policies
        likely to dramatically increase prices across a range of consumer categories. North Carolina families
        regularly buy products that come from Mexico, Canada, China, and Europe – products that will now be hit with
        tariffs ranging from 10% to over 100%. The capriciousness of Trump’s economic policies has also caused
        uncertainty: since Trump's inauguration, consumer sentiment has fallen, and more North Carolinians expect a
        recession in the near term.</p>
